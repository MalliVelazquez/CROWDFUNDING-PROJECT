# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Analyze the different projects and their acceptance by the public in order to make decisions and evaluating the project in general.

### Purpose
Evaluate how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals so founders can creat more efficient strategies in marketing, publicity and more succesfull campaings that achieve more money and interest by public.

## Analysis and Challenges
For this project we take many campaigns around the world. As we all know, people with different cultures do not react the same way to different activities wich make this project a little dificult to globalize since we can find many similarities but also many opposite reactions to the same activity in different parts of the world.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
We can say people react better to activities where they get involved as music, theater or film and video. The must successful campaings were delivered on summer vacation or winter season wich can say much about the disposition that people have to attend a culture activity that involves part of their day time.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Of course we have to take into account that the campaigns with the lowest cancellation or failure percentage were those that had less ambitious goals, but we must also take into account that many of the campaigns that were a failure were activities that did not involve the public as much like others. We can give an example:
music campaigns had less failure than publishing campaigns.
The cancellation rate began to rise considerably from the goals of 25,000 USD, which can tell us about the need to extend the time of the campaign or the change in the established goals if the same advertising strategy or deadline continue.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Most people work a full time so it is difficult to find a space of time to attend activities that take up a part of their day. In each country, of course, the workforce has different economic possibilities that lead a campaign to be more or less successful depending on the region in which it has been delivered.
We must analyze in detail the campaigns and the countries in which these campaigns are presented and the established goals, since these goals must be related to the purchasing power of each region.

## Results

- Theater Outcomes by Launch Date

    - The must successful campaings were delivered on vacations season so campaings must be releated to public free time.
    - Different ages of people attend this campaing so we must analyse ages range so campaing can be delivered in free time season.

- Outcomes based on Goals

    -We need to analyse the puchasing power in each contry in order to decide the goal amount vs the region.
    -It's important to also analyse wich region react better for each campaing so strategies can be fixed and goal amount would be more achievable. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

  - Campaings were not delivered at same time in public so it could change the results. 
  - Campaigns can be more accessible to a certain stratum of people by region, so the data is not globalized.
  - Ages in each campaing are not delimited so results can vary in each cathegory. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

  - Outcomes based on regions.
  - Outcomes based on category.
